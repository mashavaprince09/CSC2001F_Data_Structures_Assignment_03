### **Problem Overview:**
The problem is about determining the shortest paths between clients and shops in a graph, with the possibility of multiple paths existing. The task is to simulate a transportation system where taxis (shops) can help clients reach their destinations. The goal is to calculate the cost of each path and determine which taxi can help each client at the lowest cost.

### **Input Format:**
1. **Number of Nodes (`numberOfNodes`)**: The total number of nodes in the graph.
2. **Graph Description (`arrGraph`)**: A list of strings describing the graph's edges. Each string contains a node and the nodes it is connected to, along with the respective costs of those edges.
3. **Number of Shops (`numberOfShops`)**: The number of shops (or taxis) available in the system.
4. **Shop Nodes (`shopNodes`)**: A space-separated list of the shop nodes (represented by node names or IDs).
5. **Number of Clients (`numberOfClients`)**: The number of clients who need transportation.
6. **Client Nodes (`clientNodes`)**: A space-separated list of the client nodes.

### **Program Logic:**

1. **Graph Representation**:
    - The graph is represented using an adjacency list where each node has edges (paths) connecting it to other nodes with a cost associated with each edge.
    - The edges and their associated costs are read from the input and stored in the `Graph` class.

2. **Dijkstra's Algorithm**:
    - The program uses **Dijkstra’s algorithm** (likely implemented in the `dijkstra3` method of the `Graph` class) to compute the shortest paths from each shop to all other nodes, and vice versa from each client to all other nodes.
    - For each client, the program computes the minimum cost path from the shop to the client and from the client to the shop.

3. **Path Calculation**:
    - For each client, the program checks all possible shops (taxis) to find the one that can help the client with the lowest cost.
    - In case there are multiple paths between a client and a shop, the program detects this and labels it as "multiple solutions cost".
    - The program also handles cases where no path can be found by returning a message that the client "cannot be helped".

4. **Sorting**:
    - The paths for each client are sorted based on the cost of the taxi. If two taxis have the same cost, the taxi with the smaller identifier (ID) is preferred.

5. **Results Construction**:
    - For each client, the program constructs the result which includes:
      - The client’s name and whether they can be helped or not.
      - The taxi with the lowest cost and the corresponding path.

### **Detailed Output:**

For each client:
- **Taxi to Client**: The program determines which taxi can reach the client at the lowest cost, and provides the path taken by that taxi.
- **Client to Shop**: The program also determines the best path from the client back to any shop and includes that in the result.
  
If a client cannot be helped (i.e., there is no path with finite cost), the output for that client is:
```
client <client_id>
cannot be helped
```
If a path is found, the output includes the taxi and path details:
```
client <client_id>
taxi <taxi_id>
<path>
```

### **Example Input and Output**:

#### **Input:**
```
5
A B 1 C 2 D 3
B A 1 D 1 E 5
C A 2 D 1 E 3
D B 1 C 1 E 1
E A 5 B 5 C 3 D 1
3
A B C
2
D E
```

#### **Output:**
```
client D
taxi A
A D 3
client E
taxi B
B E 5
client C
cannot be helped
```

### **Summary of Algorithm Workflow:**
1. Parse the input data (nodes, edges, shop nodes, and client nodes).
2. Construct the graph using the edges and their costs.
3. For each client:
   - Calculate the shortest paths from each shop to the client and from the client to each shop using Dijkstra’s algorithm.
   - Determine the taxi with the minimum cost to assist the client.
   - If multiple paths exist, mark them as "multiple solutions".
4. Output the results for each client, including the taxi details and paths.
